## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later (for building from source)
- Swift 5.9 or later

## Building from Source

### Quick Build (Swift Package Manager)

```bash
cd ZipViewer
swift build
swift run
```

### Build macOS App Bundle

```bash
./build-app.sh
```

This creates a full `.app` bundle at `.build/release/ZipViewer.app` with:
- Custom app icon
- File associations for .zip files
- Proper bundle structure for distribution

To install:
```bash
open .build/release/ZipViewer.app  # Run the app
# or
cp -r .build/release/ZipViewer.app /Applications/  # Install to Applications
```

### Build with Xcode

```bash
open Package.swift
# Then press Cmd+R to run
```

## Usage

### Opening a Zip File

1. **Drag & Drop**: Drag a .zip file onto the application window
2. **File Menu**: Use Cmd+O or File â†’ Open to select a zip file
3. **Double-click**: Associate .zip files with Grizzly and open them directly

### Navigating Contents

- **Double-click folders** to navigate into them
- **Double-click files** to extract and open them with default application
- **Back button** or breadcrumb navigation to go up directories
- Single-click to select a file or folder

### Previewing & Opening Files

## Architecture

The app is built using modern SwiftUI patterns:

- **Models**: `ZipEntry` for representing archive contents, `ZipArchiveManager` for archive operations
- **ViewModels**: `AppState` for managing application state
- **Views**: SwiftUI components for the user interface
